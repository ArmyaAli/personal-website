                    <p>My name is Ali and I grew up in Canada. I was born in Pakistan but my family came to Toronto when I was just a year old which let me grow up in Canada. I love programming, technology and going to the gym.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've built my own computer, played around with my many different technologies and worked as an intern web developer for almost a year.
                    </p>
                    <p>I currently go to Seneca College and study Computer Engineering Technology which is a mixture of electrical engineering and programming.

                    <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineering with a passion for technology while keeping up to date of all the new emerging programming tools that could be the next new thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, I built this website without a framework because I wanted to hone basic skills. As a developer I believe that if you have a strong foundational knowledge, you can pick up any tool you or your employer require.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also believe that as a software developer it is a must that you continue learning new things, keep up with the ever changing world of tech and continue to hone and practice your basic skills.

                    <p>This website was mainly used to show off to people. I created this website within a few days and I think it's pretty neat. It's hosted with Google's Firebase cloud platform which is essentially a Backend as a service relatable to Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. For the particles I am using the open source particles.js (https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and to show my resume across all browsers I am using Mozilla's PDF.js (https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)</p>
                    <p>I want people to see this website and think I'm a cool guy. Maybe somebody will see this site and decide to hire me. Haha, if that ever happens I know that I am doing something right.</p>
                    <!-- <p>During my internship I mostly used MS Azure in my day to day job. The majority of my work consisted of front-end logic using the Angular Framework by google. I also got the chance to use a serverside technology called Elasticsearch which is part of something called the "ELK" Stack. This type technology is meant to be used for big data analysis and offers a large amount of tools for highly scalable enterprise applications. I also was able to create a REST API using ASP.NET.</p> -->
